    "\n",
    "Complete Case Analysis (Listwise deletion): This method involves excluding participants with missing data \n",
    "from the analysis. It only uses cases with complete data, leading to a reduction in sample size. This approach\n",
    "can introduce bias if the missingness is related to the variables being analyzed, potentially impacting the\n",
    "representativeness of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairwise Deletion: With this approach, participants with missing data on specific variables are excluded only \n",
    "from the analyses involving those variables. It uses all available data, but can lead to biased results if the\n",
    "missingness is not random. The estimation of standard errors and statistical power may also be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Imputation: This method replaces missing values with the mean of the available data for the respective\n",
    "variable. It assumes that the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR) and can lead to biased\n",
    "estimates if the missingness is related to the outcome variable or other covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF): This approach carries forward the last observed value for missing\n",
    "data points. It assumes that missing data points remain constant over time. However, LOCF can introduce bias\n",
    "if the assumption is violated or if there is substantial change in the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Imputation: This technique involves creating multiple plausible imputations for the missing data based\n",
    "on statistical models. The imputed datasets are then analyzed separately, and the results are combined using\n",
    "specific rules. Multiple imputation accounts for uncertainty due to missing data and produces unbiased estimates\n",
    "when certain assumptions are met. However, it can be computationally intensive and requires careful implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of method to handle missing data should be based on the assumptions about the missingness mechanism\n",
    "and the potential consequences of each method. It is important to consider the potential bias, loss of power,\n",
    "and generalizability of the results associated with each approach. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses can be conducted\n",
